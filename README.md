# Odin8.5-Library
A library to keep track of books and movies.


WHat's the point?

What about the reivewed ones go bottom?   Unread ones make up a list of NEXT reads.

What about two lists?  
Read + Review + Recommendation ?

Wishlist Reading.

## Notes from 10/18
Overall, did things from 10/17 notese.   added blur, centered form, added forms, toggl through thee first form and move into the second.

Things to do now : 
fix the forms.  They don't reflect what you see in the data. 
Toggle the read / not read toggle.  
change via js what the bottom div section looks like. 

form submits all the information?   clear out the other info when toggled between?

escape key quits the box.
click anywhere else escapes thee box.




HOW DO I SUBMIT THE FORM?

how do I draw the cards?
I made a media card, now, I have to style it right? 
what happenns when there's lots of notes?    Character limit???




## Notes from 10/17

Got button to work. Need to change what happens. It shouldn't shift everything, but put the form on front.
- fixed this. 

Form needs to change to reflect whta you're adding.
Box with three boxes inside?   Movie, game, film?
- fixed

how do you distinguish the media types.   Whata color?      Need outlines / shadows for them?
- thought about it.. 

how do I deal with the entry button?   How does it show the information?


Can I sort the movies?   

How can I save?
